# Gatsby Portfolio Website

I have rebuilt my portfolio website in GatsbyJS as a personal challenge, specially to start working with Static site generators, that are trending at the moment, and also to gain experience with Netlify build process and also play around with GraphQL.

Feel free to use this project as a template for your own.

## 🚀 How to

Clone the repo, then run...

    npm install
    npx gatsby develop

And start editing!

## 🧐 What have i done so far?

I´ve became familiar with the gatsby plugins, started playing around with yaml and markdown files using the transform plugins to generate HTML for react to consume, with the help of GraphQL queries.

## 💫 Live demo

The project will be hosted in Netlify in the very near future.

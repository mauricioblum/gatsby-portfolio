# Gatsby Portfolio Website

I have rebuilt my portfolio website in GatsbyJS as a personal challenge, specially to start working with Static site generators, that are trending at the moment, and also to gain experience with Netlify build process and also play around with GraphQL.

Feel free to use this project as a template for your own.
